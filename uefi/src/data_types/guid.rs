/// Several entities in the UEFI specification can be referred to by their GUID,
/// this trait is a building block to interface them in uefi-rs.

/// You should never need to use the `Identify` trait directly, but instead go
/// for more specific traits such as [`Protocol`] or [`FileProtocolInfo`], which

/// For the common case of implementing this trait for a protocol, use

/// # Safety
///
/// Implementing `Identify` is unsafe because attaching an incorrect GUID to a
/// type can lead to type unsafety on both the Rust and UEFI side.
