/// Generic file information
///
/// The following rules apply when using this struct with `set_info()`:
///
/// - On directories, the file size is determined by the contents of the
///   directory and cannot be changed by setting `file_size`. This member is
///   ignored by `set_info()`.
/// - The `physical_size` is determined by the `file_size` and cannot be
///   changed. This member is ignored by `set_info()`.
/// - The `FileAttribute::DIRECTORY` bit cannot be changed. It must match the
///   fileâ€™s actual type.
/// - A value of zero in create_time, last_access, or modification_time causes
///   the fields to be ignored (and not updated).
/// - It is forbidden to change the name of a file to the name of another
///   existing file in the same directory.
/// - If a file is read-only, the only allowed change is to remove the read-only
///   attribute. Other changes must be carried out in a separate transaction.
